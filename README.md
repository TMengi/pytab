# PyTab

This is a module to easily input and visualize guitar tablature in a way that makes sense to me.

Input will be gathered via a curses display after specifying a tuning and capo placement.

Options in the display:
- press a button to insert a bar
- move cursor with arrow keys
- type a letter or number to put it into the tab
- press a button to save the tab to a file
